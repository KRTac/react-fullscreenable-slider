# react-responsive-slider

A responsive content slider with integrated lightbox and fullscreen
functionality.

Work in progress, not ready for production.

## Development

Install using the `--legacy-peer-deps` option for `npm` and run storybook:

```sh
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run storybook
```

**Note:** `--legacy-peer-deps` is needed because of an old peer dependencie for
react in `@mdx-js/react`.


### Build

```sh
npm run rollup
```
