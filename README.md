# react-responsive-slider

A responsive content slider with integrated lightbox and fullscreen
functionality.

Work in progress, not ready for production.

## Development

Install using the `--legacy-peer-deps` option for `npm` and run storybook:

```shell
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run storybook
```

**Note:** `--legacy-peer-deps` is needed because, at the moment of writing,
`@mdx-js/react` (required by storybook) didn't update the referance to include
react 18.


### Build

```shell
npm run rollup
```
